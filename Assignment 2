2 - Logistic Regression
In this part of the exercise, you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.


2.1 Problem Statement
Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams.

You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression.
For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.

2.2 Loading and visualizing the data
You will start by loading the dataset for this task.

The load_dataset() function shown below loads the data into variables X_train and y_train
X_train contains exam scores on two exams for a student
y_train is the admission decision
y_train = 1 if the student was admitted
y_train = 0 if the student was not admitted
Both X_train and y_train are numpy arrays.
# load dataset
X_train, y_train = load_data("data/ex2data1.txt")
View the variables
Let's get more familiar with your dataset.

A good place to start is to just print out each variable and see what it contains.
The code below prints the first five values of X_train and the type of the variable.

print("First five elements in X_train are:\n", X_train[:5])
print("Type of X_train:",type(X_train))
First five elements in X_train are:
 [[34.62365962 78.02469282]
 [30.28671077 43.89499752]
 [35.84740877 72.90219803]
 [60.18259939 86.3085521 ]
 [79.03273605 75.34437644]]
Type of X_train: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
Now print the first five values of y_train

print("First five elements in y_train are:\n", y_train[:5])
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))
First five elements in y_train are:
 [0. 0. 0. 1. 1.]
Type of y_train: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
Check the dimensions of your variables
Another useful way to get familiar with your data is to view its dimensions. Let's print the shape of X_train and y_train and see how many training examples we have in our dataset.

print ('The shape of X_train is: ' + str(X_train.shape))
print ('The shape of y_train is: ' + str(y_train.shape))
print ('We have m = %d training examples' % (len(y_train)))
The shape of X_train is: (100, 2)
The shape of y_train is: (100,)
We have m = 100 training examples
Visualize your data
Before starting to implement any learning algorithm, it is always good to visualize the data if possible.

The code below displays the data on a 2D plot (as shown below), where the axes are the two exam scores, and the positive and negative examples are shown with different markers.
We use a helper function in the utils.py file to generate this plot.

# Plot examples
plot_data(X_train, y_train[:], pos_label="Admitted", neg_label="Not admitted")
​
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Exam 2 score') 
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Exam 1 score') 
plt.legend(loc="upper right")
plt.show()

Your goal is to build a logistic regression model to fit this data.

With this model, you can then predict if a new student will be admitted based on their scores on the two exams.

2.3 Sigmoid function
Recall that for logistic regression, the model is represented as

𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝑥)=𝑔(𝐰⋅𝐱+𝑏)
where function 𝑔
 is the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function is defined as:

𝑔(𝑧)=11+𝑒−𝑧
Let's implement the sigmoid function first, so it can be used by the rest of this assignment.


Exercise 1
Please complete the sigmoid function to calculate

𝑔(𝑧)=11+𝑒−𝑧
Note that

z is not always a single number, but can also be an array of numbers.
If the input is an array of numbers, we'd like to apply the sigmoid function to each value in the input array.
If you get stuck, you can check out the hints presented after the cell below to help you with the implementation.

# UNQ_C1
# GRADED FUNCTION: sigmoid
​
def sigmoid(z):
    """
    Compute the sigmoid of z
​
    Args:
        z (ndarray): A scalar, numpy array of any size.
​
    Returns:
        g (ndarray): sigmoid(z), with the same shape as z
         
    """
          
    ### START CODE HERE ### 
    g = 1/(1+np.exp(-z))
    
    ### END SOLUTION ###  
    
    return g
Click for hints
When you are finished, try testing a few values by calling sigmoid(x) in the cell below.

For large positive values of x, the sigmoid should be close to 1, while for large negative values, the sigmoid should be close to 0.
Evaluating sigmoid(0) should give you exactly 0.5.
# Note: You can edit this value
value = 0
​
print (f"sigmoid({value}) = {sigmoid(value)}")
sigmoid(0) = 0.5
Expected Output:

sigmoid(0)	0.5
As mentioned before, your code should also work with vectors and matrices. For a matrix, your function should perform the sigmoid function on every element.
print ("sigmoid([ -1, 0, 1, 2]) = " + str(sigmoid(np.array([-1, 0, 1, 2]))))
​
# UNIT TESTS
from public_tests import *
sigmoid_test(sigmoid)
sigmoid([ -1, 0, 1, 2]) = [0.26894142 0.5        0.73105858 0.88079708]
All tests passed!
Expected Output:

sigmoid([-1, 0, 1, 2])	[0.26894142 0.5 0.73105858 0.88079708]

2.4 Cost function for logistic regression
In this section, you will implement the cost function for logistic regression.


Exercise 2
Please complete the compute_cost function using the equations below.

Recall that for logistic regression, the cost function is of the form

𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1[𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖)),𝑦(𝑖))](1)
where

m is the number of training examples in the dataset
𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖)),𝑦(𝑖))
 is the cost for a single data point, which is -

𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖)),𝑦(𝑖))=(−𝑦(𝑖)log(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖)))−(1−𝑦(𝑖))log(1−𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖)))(2)
𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))
 is the model's prediction, while 𝑦(𝑖)
, which is the actual label

𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))=𝑔(𝐰⋅𝐱(𝐢)+𝑏)
 where function 𝑔
 is the sigmoid function.

It might be helpful to first calculate an intermediate variable 𝑧𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))=𝐰⋅𝐱(𝐢)+𝑏=𝑤0𝑥(𝑖)0+...+𝑤𝑛−1𝑥(𝑖)𝑛−1+𝑏
 where 𝑛
 is the number of features, before calculating 𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))=𝑔(𝑧𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖)))
Note:

As you are doing this, remember that the variables X_train and y_train are not scalar values but matrices of shape (𝑚,𝑛
) and (𝑚
,1) respectively, where 𝑛
 is the number of features and 𝑚
 is the number of training examples.
You can use the sigmoid function that you implemented above for this part.
If you get stuck, you can check out the hints presented after the cell below to help you with the implementation.

# UNQ_C2

      b : (scalar)              value of bias parameter of the model

      total_cost : (scalar) cost

​
    m, n = X.shape

    loss = 0
    for i in range(m):

        loss += -y[i]*np.log(f_wb) - (1-y[i])*np.log(1-f_wb)
    total_cost = loss/m
        
​
    ### END CODE HERE ### 
​
    return total_cost

 and 𝑏

test_w = np.array([0.2, 0.2])
test_b = -24.

# UNIT TESTS
compute_cost_test(compute_cost)
Cost at test w and b (non-zeros): 0.218
All tests passed!
Expected Output:

Cost at test w and b (non-zeros):	0.218

2.5 Gradient for logistic regression
In this section, you will implement the gradient for logistic regression.

Recall that the gradient descent algorithm is:

repeat until convergence:{𝑏:=𝑏−𝛼∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑏𝑤𝑗:=𝑤𝑗−𝛼∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑤𝑗}for j := 0..n-1(1)
where, parameters 𝑏
, 𝑤𝑗
 are all updated simultaniously


Exercise 3
Please complete the compute_gradient function to compute ∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑤
, ∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑏
 from equations (2) and (3) below.

∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑏=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))−𝐲(𝑖))(2)
∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑤𝑗=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))−𝐲(𝑖))𝑥(𝑖)𝑗(3)
m is the number of training examples in the dataset
𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))
 is the model's prediction, while 𝑦(𝑖)
 is the actual label
Note: While this gradient looks identical to the linear regression gradient, the formula is actually different because linear and logistic regression have different definitions of 𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝑥)
.
As before, you can use the sigmoid function that you implemented above and if you get stuck, you can check out the hints presented after the cell below to help you with the implementation.

2.6 Learning parameters using gradient descent
Similar to the previous assignment, you will now find the optimal parameters of a logistic regression model by using gradient descent.

You don't need to implement anything for this part. Simply run the cells below.

A good way to verify that gradient descent is working correctly is to look at the value of 𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)
 and check that it is decreasing with each step.

Assuming you have implemented the gradient and computed the cost correctly, your value of 𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)
 should never increase, and should converge to a steady value by the end of the algorithm.

def gradient_descent(X, y, w_in, b_in, cost_function, gradient_function, alpha, num_iters, lambda_): 
    """

    num_iters gradient steps with learning rate alpha

    Returns:
      w : (ndarray Shape (n,)) Updated values of parameters of the model after
          running gradient descent

          running gradient descent
    """
    
    # number of training examples
    m = len(X)
    
    # An array to store cost J and w's at each iteration primarily for graphing later
    J_history = []
    w_history = []
    
    for i in range(num_iters):
​
        # Calculate the gradient and update the parameters
        dj_db, dj_dw = gradient_function(X, y, w_in, b_in, lambda_)   
​
        # Update Parameters using w, b, alpha and gradient
        w_in = w_in - alpha * dj_dw               
        b_in = b_in - alpha * dj_db              
       
        # Save cost J at each iteration
        if i<100000:      # prevent resource exhaustion 
            cost =  cost_function(X, y, w_in, b_in, lambda_)
            J_history.append(cost)
​
        # Print cost every at intervals 10 times or as many iterations if < 10
        if i% math.ceil(num_iters/10) == 0 or i == (num_iters-1):
            w_history.append(w_in)
            print(f"Iteration {i:4}: Cost {float(J_history[-1]):8.2f}   ")
        
    return w_in, b_in, J_history, w_history #return w and J,w history for graphing
Now let's run the gradient descent algorithm above to learn the parameters for our dataset.

Note The code block below takes a couple of minutes to run, especially with a non-vectorized version. You can reduce the iterations to test your implementation and iterate faster. If you have time later, try running 100,000 iterations for better results.

np.random.seed(1)
initial_w = 0.01 * (np.random.rand(2) - 0.5)
initial_b = -8
​
# Some gradient descent settings
iterations = 10000
alpha = 0.001
​
w,b, J_history,_ = gradient_descent(X_train ,y_train, initial_w, initial_b, 
                                   compute_cost, compute_gradient, alpha, iterations, 0)
Iteration    0: Cost     0.96   
Iteration 1000: Cost     0.31   
Iteration 2000: Cost     0.30   
Iteration 3000: Cost     0.30   
Iteration 4000: Cost     0.30

Iteration 9000: Cost     0.30   
Iteration 9999: Cost     0.30   
Expected Output: Cost 0.30, (Click to see details):

2.7 Plotting the decision boundary
We will now use the final parameters from gradient descent to plot the linear fit. If you implemented the previous parts correctly, you should see a plot similar to the following plot:


We will use a helper function in the utils.py file to create this plot.

plot_decision_boundary(w, b, X_train, y_train)
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Exam 2 score') 
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Exam 1 score') 
plt.legend(loc="upper right")
plt.show()


2.8 Evaluating logistic regression
We can evaluate the quality of the parameters we have found by seeing how well the learned model predicts on our training set.

You will implement the predict function below to do this.


Exercise 4
Please complete the predict function to produce 1 or 0 predictions given a dataset and a learned parameter vector 𝑤
 and 𝑏
.

First you need to compute the prediction from the model 𝑓(𝑥(𝑖))=𝑔(𝑤⋅𝑥(𝑖)+𝑏)
 for every example

You've implemented this before in the parts above
We interpret the output of the model (𝑓(𝑥(𝑖))
) as the probability that 𝑦(𝑖)=1
 given 𝑥(𝑖)
 and parameterized by 𝑤
.

Therefore, to get a final prediction (𝑦(𝑖)=0
 or 𝑦(𝑖)=1
) from the logistic regression model, you can use the following heuristic -

if 𝑓(𝑥(𝑖))>=0.5
, predict 𝑦(𝑖)=1
if 𝑓(𝑥(𝑖))<0.5
, predict 𝑦(𝑖)=0
If you get stuck, you can check out the hints presented after the cell below to help you with the implementation.

Expected output

Output of predict: shape (4,),value [0. 1. 1. 1.]
Now let's use this to compute the accuracy on the training set

#Compute accuracy on our training set
p = predict(X_train, w,b)
print('Train Accuracy: %f'%(np.mean(p == y_train) * 100))
Train Accuracy: 92.000000
Train Accuracy (approx):	92.00

3 - Regularized Logistic Regression
In this part of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.


3.1 Problem Statement
Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests.

From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected.
To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.

3.2 Loading and visualizing the data
Similar to previous parts of this exercise, let's start by loading the dataset for this task and visualizing it.

The load_dataset() function shown below loads the data into variables X_train and y_train
X_train contains the test results for the microchips from two tests
y_train contains the results of the QA
y_train = 1 if the microchip was accepted
y_train = 0 if the microchip was rejected
Both X_train and y_train are numpy arrays.
# load dataset
X_train, y_train = load_data("data/ex2data2.txt")
View the variables
The code below prints the first five values of X_train and y_train and the type of the variables.

# print X_train
print("X_train:", X_train[:5])
print("Type of X_train:",type(X_train))
​
# print y_train
print("y_train:", y_train[:5])
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))
X_train: [[ 0.051267  0.69956 ]
 [-0.092742  0.68494 ]
 [-0.21371   0.69225 ]
 [-0.375     0.50219 ]
 [-0.51325   0.46564 ]]
Type of X_train: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
y_train: [1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]
Type of y_train: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
Check the dimensions of your variables
Another useful way to get familiar with your data is to view its dimensions. Let's print the shape of X_train and y_train and see how many training examples we have in our dataset.

print ('The shape of X_train is: ' + str(X_train.shape))
print ('The shape of y_train is: ' + str(y_train.shape))
print ('We have m = %d training examples' % (len(y_train)))
The shape of X_train is: (118, 2)
The shape of y_train is: (118,)
We have m = 118 training examples
Visualize your data
The helper function plot_data (from utils.py) is used to generate a figure like Figure 3, where the axes are the two test scores, and the positive (y = 1, accepted) and negative (y = 0, rejected) examples are shown with different markers.



# Plot examples
plot_data(X_train, y_train[:], pos_label="Accepted", neg_label="Rejected")
​
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Microchip Test 2') 
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Microchip Test 1') 
plt.legend(loc="upper right")
plt.show()

Figure 3 shows that our dataset cannot be separated into positive and negative examples by a straight-line through the plot. Therefore, a straight forward application of logistic regression will not perform well on this dataset since logistic regression will only be able to find a linear decision boundary.


3.3 Feature mapping
One way to fit the data better is to create more features from each data point. In the provided function map_feature, we will map the features into all polynomial terms of 𝑥1
 and 𝑥2
 up to the sixth power.

map_feature(𝑥)=𝑥1𝑥2𝑥21𝑥1𝑥2𝑥22𝑥31⋮𝑥1𝑥52𝑥62
As a result of this mapping, our vector of two features (the scores on two QA tests) has been transformed into a 27-dimensional vector.

A logistic regression classifier trained on this higher-dimension feature vector will have a more complex decision boundary and will be nonlinear when drawn in our 2-dimensional plot.
We have provided the map_feature function for you in utils.py.
print("Original shape of data:", X_train.shape)
​
mapped_X =  map_feature(X_train[:, 0], X_train[:, 1])
print("Shape after feature mapping:", mapped_X.shape)
Original shape of data: (118, 2)
Shape after feature mapping: (118, 27)
Let's also print the first elements of X_train and mapped_X to see the tranformation.

print("X_train[0]:", X_train[0])
print("mapped X_train[0]:", mapped_X[0])
X_train[0]: [0.051267 0.69956 ]
mapped X_train[0]: [5.12670000e-02 6.99560000e-01 2.62830529e-03 3.58643425e-02

While the feature mapping allows us to build a more expressive classifier, it is also more susceptible to overfitting. In the next parts of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression to fit the data and also see for yourself how regularization can help combat the overfitting problem.


3.4 Cost function for regularized logistic regression
In this part, you will implement the cost function for regularized logistic regression.

Recall that for regularized logistic regression, the cost function is of the form
𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1[−𝑦(𝑖)log(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖)))−(1−𝑦(𝑖))log(1−𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖)))]+𝜆2𝑚∑𝑗=0𝑛−1𝑤2𝑗
Compare this to the cost function without regularization (which you implemented above), which is of the form

𝐽(𝐰.𝑏)=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1[(−𝑦(𝑖)log(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖)))−(1−𝑦(𝑖))log(1−𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖)))]
The difference is the regularization term, which is
𝜆2𝑚∑𝑗=0𝑛−1𝑤2𝑗
Note that the 𝑏
 parameter is not regularized.


Exercise 5
Please complete the compute_cost_reg function below to calculate the following term for each element in 𝑤
𝜆2𝑚∑𝑗=0𝑛−1𝑤2𝑗
The starter code then adds this to the cost without regularization (which you computed above in compute_cost) to calculate the cost with regulatization.

If you get stuck, you can check out the hints presented after the cell below to help you with the implementation.

initial_b = 0.5

Regularized cost : 0.6618252552483948
All tests passed!
Expected Output:

Regularized cost :	0.6618252552483948

3.5 Gradient for regularized logistic regression
In this section, you will implement the gradient for regularized logistic regression.

The gradient of the regularized cost function has two components. The first, ∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑏
 is a scalar, the other is a vector with the same shape as the parameters 𝐰
, where the 𝑗th
 element is defined as follows:

∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑏=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))−𝑦(𝑖))
∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑤𝑗=(1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))−𝑦(𝑖))𝑥(𝑖)𝑗)+𝜆𝑚𝑤𝑗for 𝑗=0...(𝑛−1)
Compare this to the gradient of the cost function without regularization (which you implemented above), which is of the form
∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑏=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))−𝐲(𝑖))(2)
∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑤𝑗=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝐰,𝑏(𝐱(𝑖))−𝐲(𝑖))𝑥(𝑖)𝑗(3)
As you can see,∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑏
 is the same, the difference is the following term in ∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑤
, which is
𝜆𝑚𝑤𝑗for 𝑗=0...(𝑛−1)

Exercise 6
Please complete the compute_gradient_reg function below to modify the code below to calculate the following term

𝜆𝑚𝑤𝑗for 𝑗=0...(𝑛−1)
The starter code will add this term to the ∂𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)∂𝑤
 returned from compute_gradient above to get the gradient for the regularized cost function.

If you get stuck, you can check out the hints presented after the cell below to help you with the implementation.

3.6 Learning parameters using gradient descent
Similar to the previous parts, you will use your gradient descent function implemented above to learn the optimal parameters 𝑤
,𝑏
.

If you have completed the cost and gradient for regularized logistic regression correctly, you should be able to step through the next cell to learn the parameters 𝑤
.
After training our parameters, we will use it to plot the decision boundary.
Note

The code block below takes quite a while to run, especially with a non-vectorized version. You can reduce the iterations to test your implementation and iterate faster. If you have time later, run for 100,000 iterations to see better results.

# Initialize fitting parameters
np.random.seed(1)
initial_w = np.random.rand(X_mapped.shape[1])-0.5
initial_b = 1.
​
# Set regularization parameter lambda_ (you can try varying this)
lambda_ = 0.01    
​
# Some gradient descent settings
iterations = 10000
alpha = 0.01
​
w,b, J_history,_ = gradient_descent(X_mapped, y_train, initial_w, initial_b, 
                                    compute_cost_reg, compute_gradient_reg, 
                                    alpha, iterations, lambda_)

Iteration 2000: Cost     0.56   
Iteration 3000: Cost     0.53   
Iteration 4000: Cost     0.51

Iteration 9000: Cost     0.45   
Iteration 9999: Cost     0.45   
Expected Output: Cost < 0.5 (Click for details)

3.7 Plotting the decision boundary
To help you visualize the model learned by this classifier, we will use our plot_decision_boundary function which plots the (non-linear) decision boundary that separates the positive and negative examples.

In the function, we plotted the non-linear decision boundary by computing the classifier’s predictions on an evenly spaced grid and then drew a contour plot of where the predictions change from y = 0 to y = 1.

After learning the parameters 𝑤
,𝑏
, the next step is to plot a decision boundary similar to Figure 4.



plot_decision_boundary(w, b, X_mapped, y_train)
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Microchip Test 2') 
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Microchip Test 1') 
plt.legend(loc="upper right")
plt.show()


3.8 Evaluating regularized logistic regression model
You will use the predict function that you implemented above to calculate the accuracy of the regularized logistic regression model on the training set

#Compute accuracy on the training set
p = predict(X_mapped, w, b)
​
print('Train Accuracy: %f'%(np.mean(p == y_train) * 100))
Train Accuracy: 82.203390
Expected Output:

Train Accuracy:~ 80%
